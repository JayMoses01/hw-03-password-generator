# Homework 03 (hw-03-password-generator) by Jay Moses


# Description

I created a random password generator containing the below functionality:
* Clicking the "Generate Password" button will initiate a series of prompts for the user to make selections on their desired password criteria and length. Password criteria can include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
* The randomly-generated password is created to match the length specified by the user (between 8 and 128 characters).
* The user cannot complete the password criteria prompts until they enter a number between 8 and 128 characters. Letters, special characters, and negative numbers are not allowed as a valid character length input.
* Once the user has made their selections, the password is written to the page.
